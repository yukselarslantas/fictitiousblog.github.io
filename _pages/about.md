I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, building on my Master’s degree from the same institution. Under Dr. Muhammed Sayın's guidance in the [Games, AI, and Networks Research Lab](https://gain.bilkent.edu.tr/), my focus spans algorithmic game theory, control theory, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. My research aims to bridge theory and practical applications in these areas.
